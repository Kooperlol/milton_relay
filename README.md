<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ‚ùì About The Project

Milton Relay is a mobile application for my school to help keep parents and the community up to date. The app includes upcoming events, important information such as the school calendar and activities schedule, a way for teachers and students to share photos, and a way for parents to notify the school of student absences. In addition, I added a Laude Point calculator recommended by the school administration. In the program, there is a admin, student, teacher, and parent interface, each with different features.
